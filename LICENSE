Alongside abiding the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, we also request you follow the two additional licencing conditions for this project...

Anything inside of /models/, /materials/, and /sounds/ do not fall under the repo licensing. These are compiled files which I am forced to distribute whenever a client downloads the game (therefore they might as well exist in the repo). I do have permission to use everything found within those folders only for this project. Everything else outside of those folders falls under our repo license, so please follow it accordingly.
If you plan to use this project for a derivative TTT like game, we request that you keep the attribution found in the scoreboard.
