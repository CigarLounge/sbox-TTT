TTT is a mafia-esque multiplayer game created using s&box. It's aimed to be the spiritual successor of [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/) but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). The goal of this project is to replicate the vanilla TTT experience with some quality of life thrown in (and cigars ðŸš¬).
