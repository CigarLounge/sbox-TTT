## MOTIVATION

TTT Reborn is aimed to be the spiritual successor of [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/) but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). Our first goal is to perfect the vanilla TTT experience. Then, similarly as we did for [TTT2](https://github.com/TTT-2/TTT2), create a framework that will allow users to extend the gamemode (i.e roles, weapons, etc).

## CONTRIBUTING
