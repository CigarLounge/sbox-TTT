TTT is aimed to be the spiritual successor of [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/) but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). The goal of this project is to replicate the vanilla TTT experience with some quality of life thrown in.

## License

https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

Alongside abiding the `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0` license, we also request you follow the two additional licencing conditions for this project...

1. Anything inside of `/models/`, `/materials/`, and `/sounds/` do **not** fall under the repo licensing. These are compiled files which I am forced to distribute whenever a client downloads the game (therefore they might as well exist in the repo). I do have permission to use everything found within those folders **only** for this project. Everything else outside of those folders falls under our repo license, so please follow it accordingly.
2. If you plan to use this project for a derivative `TTT` like game, we request that you keep the attribution found in the scoreboard and in our menu.
