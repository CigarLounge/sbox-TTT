	/// A prop that physically simulates as a single rigid body. It can be constrained to other physics objects using hinges
	/// or other constraints. It can also be configured to break when it takes enough damage.
	/// Note that the health of the object will be overridden by the health inside the model, to ensure consistent health game-wide.
	/// If the model used by the prop is configured to be used as a prop_dynamic (i.e. it should not be physically simulated) then it CANNOT be
	/// used as a prop_physics. Upon level load it will display a warning in the console and remove itself. Use a prop_dynamic instead.
